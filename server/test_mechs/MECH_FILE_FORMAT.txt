--THIS IS A TEMPLATE FOR MECHFILES--

NOTE: the order of each 'section' (started by #line) does not matter

#name
name here

#health
integer <- health amount

#movement
jump OR roll <- put either jump or roll here or 'walk' if the mech can't do either (but never both jump and roll)

NOTE: if there are more than NUM_WEAPONS #weapon sections, we will need to throw an error

#weapon
damage <- integer number here
uses   <- integer number here
range  <- integer number here
name   <- just a name here

NOTE: should throw error if any of those ints ^^ are negative

#weapon
damage <- integer number here
uses   <- integer number here
range  <- integer number here
name   <- just a name here

NOTE: should throw error if any of those ints ^^ are negative
NOTE: there's 2 #weapon sections bc currently NUM_WEAPONS is 2 :)

//weapon and mech structs for reference
typedef struct {
    int damage;
    int uses;
    int range;
    char name[MAX_NAME_LENGTH];
} weapon;

NOTE: position will be loaded randomly at start
typedef struct {
    int position;
    int health;
    uint can_jump;
    uint can_roll;
    weapon weapons[NUM_WEAPONS];
    char name[MAX_NAME_LENGTH];
} mech;
