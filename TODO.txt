rewrite game core 
    - unit test mech.c functions
    - write game_core.c, game_core.h (but better than before)
        - keep track of turn and how many actions are left so that its functions don't require player id as input
        - function to use weapon should both decrease that weapons uses and damage the enemy mech
    - unit test game core
    - have server initialize and play with a game core a little bit
- come up with system for messages between server and client and how those are gonna work
- decide what is going to be stored client state wrt game state
- implement terminal version of game but multiplayer!
