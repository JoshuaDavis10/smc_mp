1) fix up what you have
    - playtest and see if there's anything goofy u want to change
    - probably want to notify players when someone has won the game lol
    - make sure sockets are properly closing

2) port client to Windows
    - do Windows socket programming research
    - get to the point that you have your client at now but on Windows (+ any small improvements you think of during the rewrite)
    - NOTE: you will have to have a linux machine to run your server on... so when you're away from home maybe you can use CS1? alternatively, 
            you can port the server to windows too...

3) graphical version of client (Raylib)
    - store some state client size so that server only has to send "updates"
    - animate each "update"^ 
    - server should probably wait until each player has confirmed that they're done animating (?)
    - might as well do first iteration of game art at this point too

4) update game features <- this will likely take a long time?
    - heat/energy/physical/etc...
    - modules?
    - top weapons vs side weapons
    - specials?
    - this will come with a whole slew of kinks to work out + new animations/art to do
