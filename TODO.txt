2) port to Windows
    - rewrite with windows and linux in mind from get go <- get raylib compiled for linux? <- i might get around to
    doing graphics on linux eventually but I really don't feel like it right now haha 

3) graphical version of client (Raylib)
    - store some state client side so that server only has to send "updates"
    - animate each "update"^ 
    - server should probably wait until each player has confirmed that they're done animating (?)
    - might as well do first iteration of game art at this point too

4) update game features <- this will likely take a long time?
    - heat/energy/physical/etc...
    - modules?
    - top weapons vs side weapons
    - specials?
    - this will come with a whole slew of kinks to work out + new animations/art to do
