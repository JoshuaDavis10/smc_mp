0) DEBUG/UPDATE TERMINAL VERSION
    - test test test... fix any bugs you find
    - make changes where appropriate
        - e.g. server should notify clients who won instead of just terminating and not notifying clients
        - store game state client side so that server only sends "updates" instead of entire game state <- i.e. will
        have to reconfigure server messages to just be "updates", and display game info client side rather than reading
        a big string from server

1) graphical version of client (Raylib)
    - animate each "update" from server
    - server should probably wait until each player has confirmed that they're done animating (?)
    - might as well do first iteration of game art at this point too

2) update game features <- this will likely take a long time?
    - heat/energy/physical/etc...
    - modules?
    - top weapons vs side weapons
    - specials?
    - this will come with a whole slew of kinks to work out + new animations/art to do
