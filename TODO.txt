rewrite game core 
    - unit test game_core functions cuz I have no idea if I got all that bs right <- gc_initialize()/gc_shutdown() separately for each test to get
    specific scenarios
    - have server initialize and play with a game core a little bit (i.e. single player like b4)
- come up with system for messages between server and client and how those are gonna work
- decide what is going to be stored client side wrt game state
- implement terminal version of game but multiplayer!
