0) UPDATE TERMINAL VERSION
    - have server send randomly selected starting positions to both clients
    - notify P1 that it's their turn and get their command (<-- step 3)
    - notify both players that there was an update if command valid, otherwise notify current player that it's an invalid command and they need to 
    give a diff command
    - wait for both players to acknowledge update then go back to step 3

1) graphical version of client (Raylib)
    - animate each "update" from server
    - server should probably wait until each player has confirmed that they're done animating (?)
    - might as well do first iteration of game art at this point too

2) update game features <- this will likely take a long time?
    - heat/energy/physical/etc...
    - modules?
    - top weapons vs side weapons
    - specials?
    - this will come with a whole slew of kinks to work out + new animations/art to do
