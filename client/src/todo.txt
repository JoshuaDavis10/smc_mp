2 SEPARATE FILES
- socket_linux.c
- socket_windows.c
- socket.h
^^ with socketing stuff needed for the client

put all the processing stuff that client already does besides socketing into main.c file

get that working as before... test that linux versions still work

then you can start doing graphics in main.c or however you want to do it from there
